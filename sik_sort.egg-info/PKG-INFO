# Sik Sort

A command-line utility for Windows that organizes files from a specified directory into categorized folders based on file type. Sik Sort recursively processes all files and subdirectories, intelligently categorizing and moving files while handling conflicts gracefully.

## Features

- **Recursive Processing**: Automatically processes all files in a directory and its subdirectories
- **Smart Categorization**: Organizes files into four predefined categories:
  - `img` - Image files (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, webp, svg)
  - `vid` - Video files (mp4, avi, mov, mkv, wmv, flv, webm, m4v, mpg, mpeg)
  - `arc` - Archive files (zip, rar, 7z, tar, gz, bz2, xz, iso)
  - `msk` - Miscellaneous files (everything else)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically handles file name conflicts by appending unique identifiers
- **Case-Insensitive**: File extensions are matched case-insensitively
- **Statistics Display**: Shows detailed statistics after sorting with beautiful formatting
- **Empty Directory Cleanup**: Optional removal of empty directories after sorting
- **Safety Checks**: Built-in safety warnings for system directories and large operations
- **Enhanced UI**: Beautiful terminal interface powered by the Rich library

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Install from Source

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This installs Sik Sort in "editable" mode, making the `sik` command available system-wide.

### Install with Development Dependencies

If you want to run tests or contribute to development:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This includes pytest and hypothesis for testing.

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify the `sik` command is available:

```bash
sik --help
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply run the `sik` command from your terminal:

```bash
sik
```

The application will guide you through the process:

1. **Enter Source Path**: You'll be prompted to enter the directory path you want to organize
2. **Safety Checks**: The system will check for potential issues (system directories, large file counts)
3. **Scanning**: Sik Sort scans the directory to find all files
4. **Sorting**: Files are moved to their appropriate category folders with a progress bar
5. **Statistics**: A summary table shows how many files were moved to each category
6. **Cleanup**: You'll be asked if you want to remove empty directories

### Command-Line Options

```bash
sik [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--force`: Bypass safety checks (USE WITH EXTREME CAUTION!)
- `--help`: Show help message and exit

### Example Session

```
Welcome to Sik Sort!

Enter the path to the directory you want to organize: C:\Users\YourName\Downloads

```

## How It Works

1. **Category Folder Creation**: Creates four folders (img, vid, arc, msk) in your source directory
2. **File Discovery**: Recursively scans all subdirectories, excluding the category folders themselves
3. **Classification**: Each file is classified based on its extension using case-insensitive matching
4. **File Moving**: Files are moved to their appropriate category folder
5. **Conflict Handling**: If a file with the same name exists, a unique identifier is appended (e.g., `photo_1.jpg`, `photo_2.jpg`)
6. **Statistics**: Tracks and displays the number of files moved to each category
7. **Cleanup**: Optionally removes empty directories left behind after moving files

## Supported File Types

### Images (img)
jpg, jpeg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, webp, svg

### Videos (vid)
mp4, avi, mov, mkv, wmv, flv, webm, m4v, mpg, mpeg

### Archives (arc)
zip, rar, 7z, tar, gz, bz2, xz, iso

### Miscellaneous (msk)
All other file types

## Safety Features

Sik Sort includes built-in safety checks to prevent accidental damage:

- **System Directory Protection**: Warns when operating on system directories
- **Large Operation Warning**: Alerts when processing a large number of files
- **Conflict Resolution**: Never overwrites existing files
- **Category Folder Preservation**: Never deletes category folders during cleanup

You can bypass safety checks with the `--force` flag, but this is not recommended.

```

### Running Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
pytest
```

Run with verbose output:

```bash
pytest -v
```

Run specific test file:

```bash
pytest tests/test_classifier_properties.py
```

### Testing Strategy

Sik Sort uses both unit tests and property-based tests (using Hypothesis) to ensure correctness:

- **Unit Tests**: Verify specific examples and edge cases
- **Property Tests**: Verify universal properties across randomly generated inputs

Each property test runs a minimum of 100 iterations to ensure thorough coverage.

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found

If `sik` command is not found after installation:

1. Ensure pip's script directory is in your PATH
2. Try reinstalling: `pip uninstall sik-sort && pip install -e .`
3. Use the full path to the script (usually in `Scripts` folder of your Python installation)

### Permission Errors

If you encounter permission errors:

1. Run your terminal as Administrator (Windows)
2. Ensure you have write permissions to the target directory
3. Check that files aren't locked by other applications

### Files Not Moving

If files aren't being moved:

1. Check that the source path is correct
2. Verify files aren't in use by other applications
3. Ensure sufficient disk space is available
